# Destination
First ever programming project. Text based adventure game. Written during
my early programming years (2016) in the first language I learnt (C#).

The assignment was to create a text based adventure game. Keep in mind, this was before learning about classes.
Had about 3-4 weeks worth of programming knowledge writing this.
While it may not contain a story, you have two different roads, one which kills you, a second which lets you live.
Has one enemy, a spider.
